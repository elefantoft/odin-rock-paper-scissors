# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This project is part of The Odin Projects "Foundations" curriculum. I will be making a basic rock-paper-scissors game that can be played in a web browser console. In a later lesson I will return to this project and add a GUI.

This project is intended to test what I've learned about JavaScript this far.
